The scientists on Earth decided to help. They invented a giant space blanket to wrap Mars snugly. As they sent it up, they cheered, \"Let's warm up our friend!\" Slowly, the ice melted, and Mars smiled brightly, revealing its rusty hue again. The little red planet danced in joy, while Earth scientists celebrated their success. They learned that with a little science and teamwork, they could help friends, even from far away. Mars felt loved and warm once more!\n",
